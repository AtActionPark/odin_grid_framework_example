[Final Project: Design your Own Grid-Based Framework](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/design-your-own-grid-based-framework)

In this final project, you'll get to take everything you've learned and use it to build your own simple grid-based framework. As with the other final projects, we'll keep it relatively open-ended to give you a chance to exercise your creativity and problem-solving skills. It will be a great project to show off to potential employers as well.

Once you're done setting up your framework, you will use it to clone any website you like. If you're out of ideas, try cloning The Odin Project!

#Create a new HTML document and a new Github repository.

* Identify the webpage you'd like to clone and break it down into its major elements like we have in the previous projects.
* Add your framework to your project.
* Use your framework to lay out the structure of the page.
* Fill in the necessary details/images etc.
* Push your solution to Github.
* Have a frosty beverage, you're done with the HTML/CSS projects!


As lazy as it looks, I decided to "revisit" the newsweek project, replacing only bootstrap by the newly created framework to see if it could work with zero corrections. It mostly does.
